**Crop RS-Met**

The **Crop RS-Met** is a proximal (and remote) sensing-based model for ET and soil water content for crops. It is based on the satellite-based RS-Met model, which was developed for water-limited natural vegetation systems [Helman et al. 2017](https://www.biogeosciences.net/14/3909/2017/). See details on **Crop RS-Met** in [Helman et al. 2019a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377418307352) and [2019b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429018309341?dgcid=author).
